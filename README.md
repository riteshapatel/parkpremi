**Description**
Ah, I absolutely love the immense beauty of our National Parks. Believe me if I had a choice I'd be totally into park hopping :) This project is an honest attempt to build a useful app for nature lovers. 

**Dependences**
ParkPremi is a React App (of course!). API is swiftly integrated with GraphQL and Apollo. At the moment data is pulled via local JSON files. But why? Well, most of the national park data is static in nature.  

As the project grows, I will be adding Mongoose and a noSql database. Have patience young gun!

**Graphiql**

Project has Graphiql enabled on port 3003. Run / test queries using graphiql.

```
http://localhost:3003/graphiql
```

**Front End**

App is viewed on port 3000.

```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Static Data**

Data resides under api/data directory. Yes, I used NPS data api to pull this data using a REST client. As the project matures, data will be ingested from the REST endpoint.

**Bugs / Issues**

Gimme a holler if you find one :) All ears!

Fork & Enjoy!

Cheers :)
